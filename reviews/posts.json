{ "title": "GoPro Hero 5 Session", "author": 1, "date": "July 22, 2017", "content" : "My name is PJ, and this is my review on the GoPro Hero 5 Session. I want to start off by getting the most important detail out of the way- when you are buying this go-pro, you really aren’t paying that much for the camera or accompanying software. Most of what you are paying for is the tiny form factor and the incredible portability that comes along with that. The quality is not noticeably better then even the camera on my iPhone 5s, but thats probably because I don’t have a 4k screen to compare the footage of the Go-Pro at max resolution to the iPhones. However, it does have FPS for days something that really brings a lot in my opinion. Older phone cameras still shoot at 1080p 30 fps and this can get a solid sixty. Smooth frames are the biggest upgrade coming from the iPhone. The second biggest cool feature is that huge GoPro FOV, which was great for going on a boat ride to capture as much of what was going on as possible. It was super easy to hold in my hand and wasn’t bulky. I could just grab it, hit record (wait for about 2 full seconds!) and then it was capturing everything in that huge FOV. Again, the portability is is biggest if only redeeming quality. It might have seem that I liked this product, but it just turns out that to use it how I wanted to you will need to buy some additional accessories which I just haven’t wanted to shell out the cash for. Firstly, theres no stabilization on this thing, so you can try to smooth it out afterwards in software, but its gonna look weird, so you probably need some equipment to stabilize it like a gimbal. Sounds like no problem, right? WRONG. The whole point is portability and no extra-stuff. Any gimbal at all and you might as well be using the hero 5 black, which has some decent stabilization for $100 more. In fact, if I hadn’t received this as a gift, I would have just bought that one instead. The problem is that I believe it misses its own niche. For any high action sports footage you need a convenient tiny camera to strap on to something, there will be so much shaking that its not even worth it. And that it why I recommend that this product is not even worth it unless you have a fantastic computer and can stabilize everything in post filming. Still, I think the GoPro hero 5 session really misses the mark at $300, but thats just my outlook. Final Verdict- Very Specific Use Cases, good for low-profile shots that don’t have to be perfect, but just get a memory across. However, overpriced unless you really need that 4k, and its SUPER unstable and shaky with no accessories or OIS or even EIS to help it out.
